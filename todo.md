## Open

**RV-2026-06-24 — senior-dev general review (architecture + edge cases).** 10 findings from a
full read of the deterministic core, sync orchestrator, routes, and Intervals client. Done: both P1s
(RV-1, RV-2), the no-input items (RV-6 docs, RV-9 write-route test), and RV-3/RV-4 (HRV gated off but
retained + hardened). Remaining items need a decision or design call. Verdict: 8.5/10.

### P1 — fixed this session

- ☑ P1 `bug` **RV-1** — the readiness window functions computed "today" from the server's UTC date,
  while activities are matched on their LOCAL date and the rest of sync threads `resolveToday` (the
  local day). Near the UTC boundary in a non-UTC timezone the ACWR acute/chronic, load-ramp, and
  polarization windows shifted a day off the calendar the rides live on. **Fix:** `computeLoadRamp` /
  `computeAcwr` / `computeIntensityDistribution` / `computeRollingBaselines` now take a `today` arg
  (default = `utcToday()`, byte-identical to before) and anchor their offsets to `Date.parse(today)`;
  sync (GET+POST), morning-check, and `resolveCoachSignals`→CoachSnapshot all pass the resolved local
  date. 3 tests added. _[readiness.ts](lib/readiness.ts) · [sync/route.ts](app/api/sync/route.ts) ·
  [coach-snapshot.ts:117](lib/coach-snapshot.ts:117)._
- ☑ P1 `bug` **RV-2** — `/api/write` POSTed each day to Intervals.icu with `upsertOnUid=false`, so a
  partial failure (day N of M fails) left days 1..N-1 as orphaned calendar events with no local block,
  and the natural retry **duplicated** every already-written day. **Fix:** `planDayToEvent` stamps a
  deterministic `uid = nodevelo-<date>`; `createEvent` posts `upsertOnUid=true` whenever the payload
  carries a uid, so block writes are idempotent — a retry/re-write upserts the same per-day event
  instead of duplicating, and a regenerated block cleanly replaces the prior NodeVelo event on a date.
  Ad-hoc note posts (no uid) keep create semantics. 1 test added. _[plan-parser.ts](lib/plan-parser.ts) ·
  [intervals-api.ts:432](lib/intervals-api.ts:432)._ **Note:** this makes the write retry-safe but is
  not a true rollback — a deleteEvent-based cleanup of a partial set is still open (folded into RV-9).

### P2 — needs a decision or design before acting

- ☑ P2 `bug` **RV-3** — HRV gated OUT of readiness by default (no overnight HRV source), code retained
  for later. `computeReadiness` takes `opts.useHrv` (default false); the suppression branch only runs
  when enabled. README §3 + the module header now state HRV is excluded-by-default / opt-in, so docs and
  code agree. Flip on with `computeReadiness(..., { useHrv: true })` once an overnight strap is worn.
  _[readiness.ts](lib/readiness.ts) · [README.md:261](README.md:261)._
- ☑ P2 `bug` **RV-4** — hardened the (now opt-in) HRV branch so it's sound when re-enabled: rejects a
  STALE reading (`MAX_HRV_STALE_DAYS = 2`, mirrors the form carry cap) and EXCLUDES today from the 7-day
  baseline so the latest reading is graded against its own history. 3 tests: off-by-default, fresh-on,
  stale-on. _[readiness.ts](lib/readiness.ts)._
- ☑ P2 `arch` **RV-5** — fixed by anchoring ledger scoring to the ride's OWN per-activity FTP. Investigation:
  sport-settings exposes only current values (no change-date), but intervals.icu stamps each activity with
  the FTP it applied (`icu_ftp`) — its own record of the FTP live that day, exact even when an FTP change
  wasn't synced for days. `buildRideScores` now uses `act.icuFtp ?? ftpForDate(date)`, so gap rides score
  against the real FTP; effective-dated physiology stays the fallback (and still drives zones + the change
  banner). 2 tests. _[score-log.ts](lib/score-log.ts) · [intervals-api.ts:228](lib/intervals-api.ts:228) ·
  [README.md:335](README.md:335)._
- ☐ P3 `arch` **RV-5b** — `reconcile` appends to `history` with no dedup/bound; `physiology.json` grows
  monotonically over years of FTP nudges. Cosmetic, and now even lower priority — RV-5 means scoring no
  longer leans on the history (it's only a fallback + the zones/change-banner source). _[physiology.ts:168](lib/physiology.ts:168)._
- ☐ P2 `feat` **RV-7** — AI spend is measured (`ai-usage.ts`) but never capped: `recordUsage` only
  accumulates; nothing refuses a call past a threshold. No circuit breaker on a runaway loop. **Decision
  needed:** soft monthly cap value + behaviour (warn vs hard-429 from the LLM routes). _[ai-usage.ts](lib/ai-usage.ts)._

### P3 — altitude / cleanup

- ☑ P3 `audit` **RV-6** — documented the two interval-matcher tradeoffs that were implicit: (a) the
  structural-mismatch guard intentionally launders a deliberately-short-but-strong session into a pass
  (false-positive accepted to dodge detection noise), and (b) order-based rep alignment mis-aligns every
  rep after a skipped middle rep. Comment-only; behaviour unchanged. _[interval-match.ts](lib/interval-match.ts)._
- ◑ P3 `test` **RV-9** — no integration test crosses the route/IO boundary; every route's orchestration
  (the part that corrupts data when wrong — RV-1/RV-2 both survived because of this) is untested. **Done:**
  `/api/write` partial-failure test (createEvent fails mid-loop → asserts `blockSaved:false`, no block/
  history write, and a stable uid on every payload) — 3 tests, the RV-2 regression guard.
  _[write/route.test.ts](app/api/write/route.test.ts)._ **Remaining:** the deleteEvent-based rollback of a
  partial set (a true rollback, beyond retry-safety), and coverage for the other mutating routes.
- ☐ P3 `refactor` **RV-8** — `anthropic-api.ts` (773 LOC: prompt strings + 5 call sites + parsing),
  `Dashboard.tsx` (529), `Trends.tsx` (508) are where complexity piles up while `lib/` stays well-split.
  Split the prompt module first (it's the one nobody will want to touch in 6 months).
- ☐ P3 `cleanup` **RV-10** — `data/` accumulates one-shot rebuild backups
  (`score-log.json.pre-rebuild-*.bak`) forever; no rotation. Gitignored so harmless, low priority.

**CR-2026-06-24 — xhigh code-review sweep of the Jun-23 logic commits + the a11y pass.** 15 findings,
verified against source. Act top-down; P1 = data-integrity, fix first.

### P1 — data-integrity (act first)

- ☑ P1 `bug` **LEDGER-1** — SYNC-2 rebuild could reclassify pre-current-block planned rides as off-plan
  (`buildRideScores` knows only the current block; block history keeps no per-day plan, so it can't be
  reconstructed). **Audit: live ledger clean** — only one block has ever existed (all 8 planned entries
  fall inside it; the 100 pre-block rides are legitimately legacy), so the rebuild caused 0 downgrades. It
  was a latent landmine (detonates on the first rebuild after a 2nd block exists). **Fix:** new
  `mergeScoreLogRebuild` guarantees a rebuild never downgrades a frozen `planned` entry to off-plan; wired
  into the rebuild branch. Off-plan/current-block/new dates still re-score. 6 tests added.
  _[score-log.ts](lib/score-log.ts) · [sync/route.ts:267](app/api/sync/route.ts:267)._
- ☑ P1 `bug` **SET-1** — settings PUT silently dropped `strainBands` / `durabilityInsertEnvelope` /
  `athleteStateWeights` (rebuilt `updated`, only re-attached `acwrBands` + `tsbModifierEdges`; full-overwrite
  wiped the rest every save). **Fix:** all three now accept+clamp via their resolvers and preserve-when-omitted
  — `strainBands` + `durabilityInsertEnvelope` in SET-1, `athleteStateWeights` accept block added with CAL-1
  once its resolver clamped. 6 route tests. _[settings/route.ts](app/api/settings/route.ts)._
- ☑ P1 `bug` **LEDGER-2** — SYNC-2 rebuild dropped frozen `formState`/`morningCheck` provenance for rides
  older than the fresh wellness window (`fresh` won the merge with `formState:undefined`, deleting
  correlation-engine data points). **Fix:** `mergeScoreLogRebuild` now carries forward any context stamp
  the re-scored `fresh` entry lacks (a fresh stamp still wins when present; context-free stays context-free).
  3 tests added. _[score-log.ts](lib/score-log.ts)._
- ☑ P1 `audit` **LEDGER-3** — `rebuildLedger` was an unguarded destructive boolean on the hot sync route
  that re-ran on every sync if set. **Fix:** persisted one-shot marker (`ledger-rebuild.json`) + pure
  `shouldRebuildLedger(requested, alreadyRebuilt, force)` predicate — a normal sync never rebuilds, a repeat
  request is refused once the marker is set, and `force:true` is the explicit re-run path. (Kept on the sync
  trigger by design: the rebuild needs fresh-sync-derived state — calibration/ftpForDate/context — so a
  standalone endpoint would just re-run a sync; the guard is the right-depth fix.) 4 predicate tests added.
  _[sync-ledger.ts](lib/sync-ledger.ts) · [sync/route.ts:158](app/api/sync/route.ts:158)._
- ☑ P1 `bug` **CAL-1** — `resolveAthleteStateWeights` was the only resolver with no clamp/ordering, so an
  extreme override could disable the lived-fatigue safety cap at [athlete-state.ts:122](lib/athlete-state.ts:122).
  **Fix:** a per-leaf `ATHLETE_STATE_WEIGHT_BOUNDS` spec + `clampLeaves` walker bounds every leaf; key
  safety invariants — `override.scoreCap` ≤70 (stays below the 80+ "primed" band) and `override.livedThreshold`
  ≤3 (only 3 lived signals exist, so the cap stays reachable); scales pinned ≥0 and ACWR optimal/danger
  sign-locked so polarity can't invert; `tsb.freshAbove` order-enforced above `deepBelow`. Resolver is the
  single chokepoint (sync + coach-snapshot both route through it). Settings PUT now accepts the override.
  5 tests added. _[calibration.ts:238](lib/calibration.ts:238)._ Deeper schema-driven unification = CAL-2.

### P2 — correctness, lower urgency / latent

- ☑ P2 `bug` **CAL-3** — durability envelope split-brain fixed: `validateSchedule` now resolves the
  durability envelope once and threads `embeddedHardPct` through `isHardDay`→`carriesEmbeddedIntensity`, so
  spacing agrees with `validatePlanProtocol` on what counts as an embedded effort. 1 test added.
  _[schedule-validate.ts](lib/schedule-validate.ts)._
- ☑ P2 `bug` **API-1** — added `numPos` (treats a present-but-zero power reading as absent), used for the
  activity `normalizedPower` and interval `npWatts`, so a 0-watt weighted-avg no longer short-circuits the
  `??` and forces IF=0. 1 test added. _[intervals-api.ts:210](lib/intervals-api.ts:210)._
- ☑ P2 `bug` **API-2** — added `numLoose` (accepts a numeric string), used for `decoupling`, so a
  string-serialised value is no longer silently dropped. Safe no-op when the API sends a number (the real
  payload does). 1 test added. _[intervals-api.ts:218](lib/intervals-api.ts:218)._
- ☑ P2 `feat` **FUEL-1** — `fuelStampFor` now keeps an explicitly-logged `0g` ride (`grams < 0` drop, not
  `<= 0`): unlogged stays `null`→absent, fasted stays `0`→a real data point for the Track-C correlation.
  `RideScoreEntry.fuel` has no consumer yet, so no behavioural ripple. _[score-log.ts:46](lib/score-log.ts:46)._

### P3 — altitude / cleanup / a11y polish

- ☑ P3 `audit` **CAL-2** (scoped) — hoisted the duplicated finite-guard `pick` to one module-level helper in
  [calibration.ts](lib/calibration.ts); the four band resolvers now share it. The full schema-driven
  unification was **deliberately not done**: the resolvers' ordering rules are heterogeneous (ACWR nudges
  up, strain nudges the lower band down, durability nudges the ceiling, TSB chains ascending), so a generic
  resolver is ~as complex as the four, and CAL-1 already closed the bug this was tied to — marginal gain vs
  regression risk on tested scoring code.
- ☑ P3 `audit` **A11Y-1** — **detector rule** (`muted-contrast` in [detect.mjs](prototypes/impeccable-audit/detect.mjs))
  flags `text-zinc-400` used as a light-mode color (≈2.6:1 on white, under AA) while passing the correct
  `text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400`. **Sweep done:** every genuine bare usage across 14 components swapped to
  the AA pattern (`text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400`; the two `dark:text-zinc-600` tiers kept their dark tier),
  including the close-× control and empty-state placeholders. Detector now reports 0 muted-contrast.
- ☑ P3 `bug` **A11Y-2** + `ux` **UI-1** — fixed together: extracted `BAND_COLOR`/`DIR`/`driverEffectClass`
  into [athlete-state-ui.tsx](components/athlete-state-ui.tsx); both StateDriversCard and AthleteStateCard
  import it, so the duplicated band/effect logic (which drifted and left the bare-`text-zinc-400` neutral
  arm in two places) is gone and the neutral arm is now `text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400` (AA) in one place.
- ☑ P3 `bug` **CAL-4** — exported `DECOUPLING_GOOD_BOUNDS` from [calibration.ts](lib/calibration.ts);
  `deriveDecouplingGood`, the calibration route, and the CalibrationPanel input/validation all share it.
- ☑ P3 `ux` **UI-2** — `CalibrationPanel.submit` now validates the `DECOUPLING_GOOD_BOUNDS` range, not just
  finiteness, so an out-of-range entry shows the error instead of being silently server-clamped.
  _[CalibrationPanel.tsx](components/CalibrationPanel.tsx)._
