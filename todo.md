## Open

**HR-2026-07-12 — hostile review of the past 3 days' commits (`619b8c4..HEAD`, UX v2 Wave 5 polish
through today's morning-check/trend-detector fixes).** 15 findings from an xhigh multi-agent review
(10 independent finder angles, 38 raw candidates deduped — one bug was independently caught by 7 of
10 angles). None shipped yet; burn down P1 first.

### P1 — correctness / data-integrity

- ☑ P1 `bug` **HR-1** — Today's trend-detector fix (`a3321c7`) only patched `trendOf()` in
  `lib/athlete-model.ts`. Three other files reimplement the identical split-half-mean trend
  algorithm and still lack the tail-turnaround guard: `halvesDir()` in
  [lib/trends-verdict.ts:27](lib/trends-verdict.ts:27), `trendDir()` in
  [components/trends/sections.tsx:12](components/trends/sections.tsx:12), and `trendArrow()` in
  [components/MultiSparkline.tsx:57](components/MultiSparkline.tsx:57). The Trends page verdict
  strip can still show "declining" on an engine/delivery/energy axis whose last two sessions have
  already recovered — the exact bug just fixed one call site over. **Fix once** in a shared helper
  all four call.
- ☑ P1 `bug` **HR-2** — `/api/generate` resolves "today" via raw
  `new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)` (UTC) at 4 separate call sites
  ([app/api/generate/route.ts:174,178,179,189](app/api/generate/route.ts:174)) instead of
  `resolveToday()`/`localToday()`. This is the AGENTS.md-documented recurring bug class, reintroduced
  in the same diff that correctly fixed it in `/api/ask` and `/api/sync` — and it breaks the CR-9
  "can't drift" guarantee `resolveCoachSignals` exists to give: a west-of-UTC athlete generating a
  block near local midnight gets a different "today" (and thus a different weekly-energy window and
  season phase) than Ask-Coach/Trends show for the same moment. 7 of 10 review angles independently
  flagged this.
- ☑ P1 `bug` **HR-3** — `reconcileInboundMoves`' conflict map (`dayAt`,
  [lib/calendar-mirror.ts:110](lib/calendar-mirror.ts:110)) is built once from the block's original
  days and never updated as the loop applies moves. Two events dragged onto the same
  originally-vacant date in one sync both pass the "target is Rest" check — the second silently
  overwrites the first instead of surfacing an occupied-day warning, permanently dropping one
  athlete-confirmed move.
- ☑ P1 `bug` **HR-4** — `writeCurrentBlock` ([lib/data-store.ts:90](lib/data-store.ts:90)) is a
  plain `writeJsonFile`, not the lock-protected `updateJsonFile` pattern `score-log.json`/
  `dispositions.json` use for exactly this reason. This diff adds several new concurrent writers of
  `current-block.json` (reschedule PUT/PATCH, morning-check PUT, sync's inbound-reconcile writes);
  two near-simultaneous requests can silently clobber each other's move with no error.
- ☑ P1 `bug` **HR-5** — **Won't-fix (athlete decision, 2026-07-12).** The IF-based over-intensity
  penalty for Z2/Recovery days was deleted ([lib/execution-score.ts:118](lib/execution-score.ts:118))
  and replaced with an HR-based judge that's a no-op when HR data is missing (no strap, sync gap).
  Re-reading the code comments at [lib/execution-score.ts:177-179](lib/execution-score.ts:177) showed
  this was a deliberate, documented tradeoff (not an oversight) when the HR-based judge replaced the
  old terrain-confounded power penalty — outdoor Z2 rides were getting falsely flagged "too hard" from
  hill/wind power spikes. Athlete confirmed: keep "no HR data → no penalty" as accepted behavior rather
  than reintroducing the terrain false-positives an IF-based fallback would bring back.

### P2 — high-value UX / correctness

- ☑ P2 `bug` **HR-6** — `MorningCheckIn`'s post-refresh verdict card
  ([components/MorningCheckIn.tsx:148](components/MorningCheckIn.tsx:148)) previews a reschedule
  suggestion recomputed live by the GET route, not the one frozen when the flag originally fired. If
  the block changes in between (a manual Move, say), the preview and what tapping Apply actually
  executes can silently diverge.
- ☑ P2 `bug` **HR-7** — `lib/trends.ts`'s new weekly-intake aggregation guards on
  `kcalConsumed > 0` ([lib/trends.ts:127](lib/trends.ts:127)) instead of `!== null`, so a
  legitimately-logged 0-kcal day (e.g. a tracked fast) silently drops out of the week's intake total
  and logged-day count — a regression vs. the codebase's own convention of treating 0 as a real
  value for this field.
- ☑ P2 `audit` **HR-8** — **Done (live smoke run, 2026-07-12).** The fuel-line prompt change
  (`9ec687b`, feeding `/api/generate`'s LLM prompt) shipped without the AGENTS.md-required live
  Anthropic smoke run. Ran it against the athlete's real (read-only) current data: the assembled
  line reads `"CURRENT FORM & FUEL (resolved — do not invent): TSB +5.7 (fresh) · ACWR low ·
  readiness Build · weight trend 7d 0.0 kg · fueling adequate."` — a live Claude Haiku call
  correctly interpreted it ("You're fresh and ready to push hard today..."). No formatting or
  comprehension issues found.
- ☑ P2 `ux` **HR-9** — **Won't-fix (finding's premise was wrong).** Rider Profile's systems tiles
  ([components/AthleteProfileForm.tsx:279](components/AthleteProfileForm.tsx:279)) dropped absolute
  watts and W/kg in `de4ebeb` ("de-duplicate Rider-profile watts — Power PRs owns the numbers").
  Verified against source: `analyzePowerProfile` only ever populates 3 system tiles (neuromuscular@5s,
  anaerobic@60s, vo2max@300s — threshold is explicitly excluded), and `POWER_CURVE_LABELS` confirms
  Power PRs' synced grid already shows exactly those durations ("5s"/"1 min"/"5 min") with the same
  watts, W/kg on hover. The de-dup commit's premise holds — the numbers ARE recoverable elsewhere on
  the same page. Minor residual: Power PRs' W/kg is hover-only (`title=`), not always-visible text,
  which is a smaller discoverability gap than "unreachable" — not worth a fix on its own.
- ☑ P2 `bug` **HR-10** — **No fix needed (verified no current defect).** `MorningCheckDecisionResult`
  returns `decision: "rest"` for both a genuine injury stop and a non-quality-day fatigue skip
  ([lib/morning-check.ts:42](lib/morning-check.ts:42)); only `flag` distinguishes them. Traced every
  current caller (`proactiveApplyBlock`, the route, `MorningCheckIn.tsx`) — all already carry `flag`/
  `reasons` alongside `decision` and none destructure `decision` alone; the UI's shared "Rest today"
  heading is itself a deliberate simplification (both cases mean "don't ride"), with the reasons text
  correctly differentiated underneath. Hypothetical-future-caller risk, not a live bug — no speculative
  type-splitting for a caller that doesn't exist.

### P3 — polish / cleanup

- ☑ P3 `bug` **HR-11** — `applyCalendarMirror`
  ([lib/calendar-mirror.ts:179](lib/calendar-mirror.ts:179)) and `/api/sync`'s inbound-reconcile loop
  ([app/api/sync/route.ts:448](app/api/sync/route.ts:448)) both `await` independent per-date
  Intervals.icu calls sequentially instead of running them concurrently — doubles mutation latency on
  any 2-date move (swap, downgrade-with-make-up).
- ☑ P3 `ux` **HR-12** — `components/MoveDay.tsx` and `components/SwapDay.tsx` are near-total
  structural duplicates (same state shape, same busy/error/note handling) differing only in HTTP
  verb and labels — extract a shared component/hook.
- ☑ P3 `bug` **HR-13** — `calendar-mirror.ts`'s `dayToEventPayload`
  ([lib/calendar-mirror.ts:16](lib/calendar-mirror.ts:16)) re-implements the event-payload shape
  `lib/plan-parser.ts`'s `planDayToEvent` already builds (the new code's own comment admits mirroring
  it) — the two can drift independently.
- ☑ P3 `bug` **HR-14** — `lib/trends.ts`'s `latestWeeklyBalance`
  ([lib/trends.ts:161](lib/trends.ts:161)) hand-rolls a 7-day date offset instead of calling
  `lib/date.ts`'s existing `isoDaysAgo`/`addDaysIso`.
- ☑ P3 `bug` **HR-15** — `/api/reschedule`'s PUT and PATCH handlers
  ([app/api/reschedule/route.ts:246](app/api/reschedule/route.ts:246)) duplicate the same
  request-parsing/existence/future-only-date validation prologue almost line for line — factor into
  one shared helper so a future validation fix doesn't have to be applied twice.
