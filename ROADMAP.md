# Nodevelo roadmap

A living backlog of unfinished / deferred work, so it's never lost between sessions. Ordered
roughly by leverage. The main goal everything is measured against: **be a coaching *layer* that
fuses signals into one coherent, self-correcting athlete model — not a re-skin of Intervals.icu.**

---

## Next up (prioritized)

### 1. Per-athlete execution-score bands  ⭐ (the remaining calibration frontier)
The execution score (`lib/execution-score.ts`) still uses **population magic numbers**:
- Per-type intensity-appropriateness IF bands (e.g. Z2 rewards IF 0.60–0.74, Threshold 0.82–0.92).
- Decoupling bands (`< 2%` great … `> 10%` poor) and the ± weightings.

Make them personal via `lib/calibration.ts` (the hybrid auto + manual pattern used for α / ACWR):
- **IF bands → derive from `physiology.json` power zones** (the athlete's %FTP zone edges *are*
  their personal IF cutoffs).
- **Decoupling "good" threshold → from `rolling-baselines.avgDecoupling90d`**, not a fixed 4%.
- Extend `AthleteCalibration` (`decouplingGood` + per-type IF bands); thread into `computeExecutionScore`.
- **Caution:** touches the frozen scoring core. Immutable ledger means changes only affect *new*
  entries. Needs careful tests + a manual-override hook; auto-derive with population fallback.

### 2. CoachSnapshot + Ask-Coach context (the "objective telemetry lens")
Build one pre-computed `CoachSnapshot` that generation and Ask-Coach read, so the LLM is handed
resolved numbers and can't invent them. Shape: `today.execution {score, completed/total,
effective%, power%, duration%}` · `form {tsb, acwr, readiness, loadRamp}` · `fuel {todayTargetKcal,
intakeVsNeed, fuelingState, weightTrend7d}` · `block {goal, week/total}` · `directives[]`.
Ask-Coach already gets block+form; **add `today.execution` + `fuel`.**

> **⚠️ Ask-Coach anti-pattern (from a real test — this is what must NOT happen).**
> Prompt: *"should I stay on plan tomorrow although I only managed 41% of the prescribed intervals?"*
> A response like *"No — skip tomorrow, you're under-recovered or under-fuelled (execution 1/10)…"*
> is **wrong**: it hallucinates a physiological cause and prescribes a skip from a single low
> session — when in this case the 41% was caused by **equipment failure** (ghost resistance), not
> fatigue. **Correct behaviour:** the coach must read the session's `disposition` (see §3) before
> diagnosing. If `compromised: equipment` → say so ("that session doesn't reflect your form —
> equipment skewed it; tomorrow stands, just refuel normally"), don't infer recovery debt. Never
> confidently diagnose under-recovery/under-fuelling or prescribe a skip off one compromised data
> point. Ask/condition, don't assert.

### 3. Adaptive logic — DONE (only the Intervals.icu calendar mirror remains)
Both halves shipped: the disposition flag + learning gate, and the auto-reschedule engine
(`lib/reschedule.ts` + `/api/reschedule` + RescheduleBanner) that detects a not-delivered quality
session and suggests/applies a make-up on the next clear rest day in the **local** block.
- **Remaining:** the reschedule rewrites the local block only — it doesn't yet move the event on
  the **Intervals.icu calendar** (needs the event-mutation API; bundle with #7 bidirectional sync).
  The banner currently tells the athlete to mirror the move manually.
- **Possible follow-up:** a *proactive* sickness/fatigue path (downgrade today + reschedule before
  the session is even missed, on a `fatigueAlert`), vs. the current reactive "you missed it" flow.

### 4. Let the validation loop accrue, then auto-down-weight
`intervention-log.json` records verdicts after a 28-day horizon but has none yet. Once data exists,
make a low hit-rate in `lib/synthesis.ts` actually **demote** that directive (today it only
annotates). Revisit ~4 weeks after the next block is written.

### 5. Signal fusion → one coherent athlete state  ⭐ (biggest gap to a "true" second brain)
The brain *surfaces* parallel signals (execution, behaviour, validation, readiness, RPE); it
doesn't *fuse* them. e.g. RPE-high + execution-down + decoupling-up → one "systemic fatigue →
recover" conclusion, not three lines. Design a single `athleteState` synthesis before
generation/readiness. This is the heart of the goal.

## UI refinements

Most of the Images 1–5 audit shipped — see "Done recently". Remaining:
- **Nutrition availability metric on the Today card** ⭐: derive an energy-availability / fuelling
  signal from the data we already have (weekly ride output kJ, weekly intake kcal, median weekly
  weight) and surface it on Today. Goal: a glanceable "are you under-fuelled?" flag, so a bad
  session can be attributed to fuelling rather than fitness. Overlaps with #6 (nutrition energy
  balance) — build the derivation once, surface on Today + feed `CoachSnapshot.fuel`. Deterministic;
  no AI. (Rough EA proxy: (intake − ride burn) per kg bodyweight; flag low.)
- **Recent Baselines — decide the *useful* set:** current tiles (Avg TSS/ride, Weekly hours,
  decoupling, cadence) are okay but not all high-value. Audit and replace with what actually informs
  training: candidates — **w/kg at threshold** (20-min power ÷ weight), **weekly TSS**, **rides/week
  consistency**, **CTL ramp rate**, **decoupling trend**. Pick ~4 that aren't redundant with the graphs.
- **Page layout / open-state density (less scrolling):** each page should show its decision-critical
  content above the fold on open. Audit Today/Plan/Trends/Profile for what's pushed below the fold,
  tighten spacing + reorder so the first screen answers "what do I do now?" without scrolling.
- **Popups where needed:** add styled `MetricTip` hovers to metrics that lack an explanation —
  the interval completion % (Img 2), the new nutrition-availability metric, Recent Baselines tiles,
  Trend Pulse tiles. Consistent hover affordance across the app.

## Larger / scoped features (when wanted)

### 6a. Event-aware (race) block planning  ⭐
Let the athlete name a target event and have block generation actually plan around it — taper,
carb-load, race-day fuelling — instead of treating the race as just another goal string.
- **Structured event:** date + priority (A/B/C) + expected duration/type. Today goals are
  free-text (`athlete_profile.md` goal+target); add a parsed/structured race field (or a small
  store) so generation knows the date deterministically.
- **Periodization anchoring:** count down to the race; if it falls in the block, the final
  ~1–2 weeks become a **taper** (KB `cycling_database.md` Taper/Event phase: reduced volume,
  freshness), and the build peaks before it.
- **Carb-load + 48h protocol:** the 36–48h-before days get elevated carb targets (KB
  `nutrition_knowledge.md` Race Week: 8–12 g/kg) wired through `lib/nutrition.ts`; the day-before
  + race morning get the **Race-Day 24h timeline** (pre-race meal T−4 to −3.5h, in-race g/h,
  caffeine protocol) baked into the planned-ride descriptions.
- **Race entry itself:** a planned event with its fuelling plan in the description.
- **Contained AI:** the KB already *holds* all of this (carb-load tables, race-week, race-day
  timeline, taper phase) + the nutrition engine computes the grams — the LLM only phrases the
  hardwired protocol into each ride's description; it must not invent fuelling numbers.
- This is the "Planned Event Framework" from the §2C audit (A/B/C races anchoring periodization),
  which never made it in. Prereq for it to feel real: the structured event + taper logic.

### 6. Nutrition energy-balance wiring + expanded fueling
- Feed the weekly graph's third axis (actual **weekly output kJ vs. weekly intake** + median weight
  trend) into a derived `fuelingState` that refines the buffer and lands in `CoachSnapshot.fuel`.
- Then expand `lib/nutrition.ts` to precise fluid + sodium + carb-gram targets pre/intra/post,
  scaled by target IF + duration. (Note: digestive-feedback tuning is gone — survey was removed —
  so IF/duration-driven, RPE as a possible proxy.)

### 7. Calendar flexibility — condition-driven swaps + bidirectional sync
- **[note]** Let the calendar reorder itself for conditions: e.g. bad weather today → do the long
  ride on a better-weather day and swap the rest of the week's layout, keeping weekly load intact.
  Athlete drags/swaps; system can also *suggest* a swap. Should respect quality-day spacing.
- Bidirectional Intervals.icu sync for the swap: **large + API-risk** — the client only has
  `createEvent`; needs move/update/delete event methods, verification the API supports mutation,
  and a polling hook for external date shifts. Scope as its own session.

### 8. NP-missing → "unverified" execution hardening
Execution already uses NP-first + time-in-zone (so descent-skew is handled). The one gap: when NP
is absent on an outdoor ride, don't score off raw avg power — stamp the entry `unverified` rather
than producing a flawed number. Small, zero-hallucination-correct.

## Done recently (context)
- **Auto-reschedule** (roadmap #3, second half): `lib/reschedule.ts` detects the most recent
  not-delivered quality session (missed / compromised / no ride) and suggests the next clear rest
  day to make it up on (no back-to-back hard days); RescheduleBanner on the Plan page applies it to
  the local block, athlete-confirmed. Intervals.icu calendar mirror still manual.
- **UI refinements (Images 1–5):** readiness card trimmed to TSB/ACWR/Polarization; Trend Pulse
  reworked to CTL + weekly-volume bar + time-in-zones bar; Trends Execution-Quality + Recent-
  Baselines compacted into a 2-col pair, with Weekly hours replacing Avg CTL; Profile modernized
  (eyebrow headings, hairline dividers, looser spacing) to match the other pages.
- Session **disposition flag + learning gate** (roadmap #3, first half): athlete marks
  Completed/Partial/Compromised(reason) on the ride card; compromised rides are kept as history
  but excluded from the execution EWMA + execution-quality metric, and surfaced to Ask-Coach so a
  fluke (e.g. equipment) can't be misread as under-recovery. `data/dispositions.json`.
- Quick UI wins: Sparkline tooltip border/guide now match the chart accent (cyan CTL / pink Pw:HR);
  removed Avg CTL from Recent Baselines; "Week W of N · N sessions to go" (also fixed rest-days
  being counted as sessions).
- Atomic writes + ledger backup/recovery (`lib/json-store.ts`).
- Synthesis: one coaching-directive block; dropped redundant `compliance-memory`.
- Calibration v1: auto-α + ACWR bands (manual override).
- Closed the learning loop: score all rides + intervention validation.
- Compliance unified into the execution/completion index; duration-aware interval scoring;
  time-in-zone polarization; physiology single-source-of-truth; Ask-Coach (block+form context).

## Decided against (don't re-propose without a real reason)
- **RxDB / better-sqlite3 reactive-DB rewrite** — contradicts the local-first JSON design; the
  desync it targeted is already fixed with refetch-on-sync.
- **Cytoscape / Obsidian-style knowledge graph** — heavyweight dep that re-presents existing data;
  against the zero-bloat mandate.
- **Post-ride structured survey** — RPE/feel already sync from Intervals.icu (`icu_rpe`).
